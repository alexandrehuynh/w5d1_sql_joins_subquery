# Pair of gloves
# Winter is coming, you must prepare for your ski holidays. The objective of this kata is to determine 
# the number of pair of gloves you can combine from the gloves you have in your drawer.

# Given an array describing the color of each glove, return the number of pairs you can combine, 
# assuming that only gloves of the same color can form pairs. 

# Examples:
# input = ["red", "green", "red", "blue", "blue"]
# output = 2 
# explanation = 1 red pair + 1 blue pair

# input = ["red", "red", "red", "red", "red", "red"]
# output = 3 
# explanation = 3 red pairs


gloves = ["red", "green", "red", "blue", "blue"]
glovesx2 = ["red", "red", "red", "red", "red", "red"]
